Directly run PCA_plot.R with the correct working directory will generate the PCA plot. The final figure in the paper is more polished aesthetically.

Raw data from three publications are not included, since they can be downloaded from GEO. The accession number is the subfolder name. Processed data are in the same directory of the R code, denated as *fc_KO-vs-WT_gene.txt.
